# Code of Conduct
> TheThunderGuyS v1.0.1, September 17th, 2019.
**********************
# Summary
*Smooth Minecraft Shadows* is a fan project created for all to share, contribute to and be productive in. 
It should be a safe environment for all contributors and visitors. 
I will not tolerate **any** form of discrimination of **any** kind; whether it be racism, gender inequality or disability. 
All opinions should be appropriate to all visitors and contributors. 

Any inappropriate language/imagery (vulgar/heavy swearing) or harassment in any form is highly punishable.
If you catch anyone violating these rules, please report it to me. (See [Reporting an incident](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#reporting-an-incident).)

Other than that you should be:
- Kind, friendly and welcoming to newcomers.
- Patient when waiting for a response (In issues or pull requests). Some people might have other lives to live and be unable to reply.
- Respectful to other's property and beliefs. It was mentioned this above but I can't stress this enough.
- Not malicious. We don't want to be the center of a crime scene. Please don't be a online predator.
- Not putting others down. Making others feel worthless to make yourself feel powerful is a poor way to live your life.
- Having fun! This doesn't have to be a formal, professional environment at all times. Some joking is okay.

Some people might not agree with what you say, you need to remember that it is okay. 
It's human nature to disagree over things however it's wrong to argue and fight over your disagreement.

# Reporting an incident
If you believe any one of the rules has been violated by anyone, whoever it may be affecting, please submit it as an [issue](https://github.com/TheThunderGuyS/SmoothMinecraftShadows/issues/new) with the label "`Conduct Violation`".
At must come with a summary of the problem and proof. I will take action. 
**It does not matter who violates the rules. It is always punishable, even to staff.**
